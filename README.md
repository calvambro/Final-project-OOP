<h1>SOS APPLICATION </h1>
to make this application, we use the Java Swing library with the help of netbeans as the IDE that we use. For features, this app will detect the user's current location and find the closest distance to the required service from the user's current location. So that users can directly contact the required service quickly and efficiently
